## Introduction

Conducting a thorough literature search is a fundamental step in academic and professional research. It helps in understanding the existing body of knowledge, identifying gaps, and building on previous work. This tutorial will guide you through the process of finding relevant papers, organizing them effectively, and reproducing key results to deepen your understanding of the field.

## Using Google Scholar

### Search with Keywords
- Start with a broad keyword related to your topic of interest.
- Use additional keywords to narrow down the search if necessary.
- Use Ctrl + F to search within an article to find the papers cited by this paper.
- Use "Cited by" and "Search within citing articles" to find follow-up papers.

You can access Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com).

### Filter Papers
- **Number of Citations:** Generally, the more citations a paper has, the better.
- **Publication Venue:** Prefer papers published in prestigious venues. You can determine the ranking of these venues using [Google Scholar metrics](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en).
- **Publication Time:** Recent papers are usually more relevant. For instance, deep learning research became more prominent after 2013, and more advanced models using ResNet emerged after 2016. Recent trends include LLMs and diffusion models post-2020.

## Understanding Publication Venues

### Types of Venues

#### Conferences
- Have specific deadlines.
- Papers are peer-reviewed by other authors.
- Notification of acceptance is usually given after about 3 months.
- Accepted papers are presented at a conference, providing networking opportunities.

#### Journals
- Do not have specific deadlines but often have special topics. Journals may periodically issue calls for papers on specific emerging trends.
- Papers undergo an editor's desk review, followed by peer review.
- The review process can take from 6 months to over a year and may involve several rounds of revision.
- In the AI domain, top conferences are preferred over top journals, while in other fields, the reverse is often true.

## Types of Papers

### Survey Papers
- Summarize and organize previous research.
- These are ideal starting points to understand a field.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Date > Citation > Publication Venue.

### Novelty Papers
- Present new discoveries and can be categorized into theory, method, and application papers. Some papers may touch on two or three factors.
- Some of these papers are often cornerstones of a field, highly cited, and published in prestigious venues.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Citation > Publication Venue > Date.
- For state-of-the-art advancements, the publication date is crucial.

## Downloading Papers

- If access to the original source is restricted, search for the paper title and look for alternative sources like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

## Organizing Papers

- **Create a Spreadsheet:** A tool to systematically organize and manage your literature collection.
  
- **Suggested Columns (sorted by Date):** 

  - **Article** The title of the paper, which usually reflects the core research question or contribution.
  
  - **Author** The names of the authors, listed in the order they appear on the paper. Knowing the authors can help identify prominent researchers in the field.
  
  - **Venue** The conference or journal where the paper was published. This can indicate the paper's credibility and impact, as some venues are more prestigious than others.
  
  - **Date** The publication date of the paper. Sorting by date helps in tracking the chronological evolution of the research topic.
  
  - **Method** A brief description of the methodology used in the paper, including any algorithms, models, or theoretical approaches. The method can often be extracted from the abstract.
  
  - **Dataset** The dataset used in the research, which is crucial for establishing a standard benchmark to compare against baselines.
  
  - **Metric** The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the proposed method, such as Accuracy, F1 score, or AUC.
  
  - **Novelty** A summary of what makes the paper unique or innovative compared to previous work. This could be a new approach, a novel application, or a significant improvement on existing methods.
  
  - **Result** The main contributions of the paper, often highlighting how well the method performed according to the chosen metrics. The contributions can be extracted from the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections.
  
  - **Link** A URL to access the paper online, whether through the publisher's website, arXiv, or other repositories.
  
  - **Code** A link to any code repository (e.g., GitHub) associated with the paper. Having access to the code can be invaluable for reproducing results or building on the work.

## Reproducing Results

- Select a foundational paper to reproduce its results, preferably one with available implementation.
- Try to find benchmark code bases that include old baseline papers.
- Use this process to deepen your understanding of the field and brainstorm new ideas.
