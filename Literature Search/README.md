## Using Google Scholar

### Search with Keywords
- Start with a broad keyword related to your topic of interest.
- Use additional keywords to narrow down the search if necessary.
- Use Ctrl + F to search within an article to find the papers cited by this paper.
- Use "Cited by" and "Search within citing articles" to find follow-up papers.

### Filter Papers
- **Number of Citations:** Generally, the more citations a paper has, the better.
- **Publication Venue:** Prefer papers published in prestigious venues. You can determine the ranking of these venues using Google Scholar metrics.
- **Publication Time:** Recent papers are usually more relevant. For instance, deep learning research became more prominent after 2013, and more advanced models using ResNet emerged after 2016. Recent trends include LLMs and diffusion models post-2020.

## Understanding Publication Venues

### Types of Venues

#### Conferences
- Have specific deadlines.
- Papers are peer-reviewed by other authors.
- Notification of acceptance is usually given after about 3 months.
- Accepted papers are presented at a conference, providing networking opportunities.

#### Journals
- Do not have specific deadlines but often have special topics. Journals may periodically issue calls for papers on specific emerging trends.
- Papers undergo an editor's desk review, followed by peer review.
- The review process can take from 6 months to over a year and may involve several rounds of revision.
- In the AI domain, top conferences are preferred over top journals, while in other fields, the reverse is often true.

## Types of Papers

### Survey (Review) Papers
- Summarize and organize previous research.
- These are ideal starting points to understand a field.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Date > Citation > Publication Venue.

### Novelty Papers
- Present new discoveries and can be categorized into theory, method, and application papers. Some papers may touch on two or three factors.
- Some of these papers are often cornerstones of a field, highly cited, and published in prestigious venues.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Citation > Publication Venue > Date.
- For state-of-the-art advancements, the publication date is crucial.

## Downloading Papers

- If access to the original source is restricted, search for the paper title and look for alternative sources like arXiv.

## Organizing Papers

- Create a spreadsheet to organize the literature.
- Suggested columns: 
```
Article	Author	Date	Method	Dataset	Metric	Novelty	Result	Link	Code
```

## Reproducing Results

- Select a foundational paper to reproduce its results, preferably one with available implementation.
- Try to find benchmark code bases that include old baseline papers.
- Use this process to deepen your understanding of the field and brainstorm new ideas.

## Additional Resources

- **Conference Deadlines:** Use websites like AI Deadlines to track important dates.
- **GitHub Repositories:** Look for "Awesome [Topic name]" repositories for curated lists of important papers.
- **Papers with Code:** A website that gathers leaderboards, data, code, and papers for various topics.
