## Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through setting up a robust Python development environment using PyCharm and Anaconda. We'll cover installation steps for different operating systems, verify your existing Python installations, and configure PyCharm for efficient coding.

## Verify Existing Python Installations
Before installing new software, check for any existing Python installations to avoid conflicts.

### Windows
- Open Command Prompt and type: `python --version` or `py --version`.
- Check installed Python versions and uninstall unnecessary ones from the Control Panel.

### Mac
- Open Terminal and type: `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
- To uninstall, remove the Python directories from `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/`.

### Linux
- Open Terminal and type: `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
- Use your package manager to uninstall unnecessary Python versions (e.g., `sudo apt-get remove python`).

## Install Anaconda
Install the latest Anaconda distribution, which includes numerous pre-installed libraries and tools for data science.

### Download Anaconda
- Go to the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download the installer for your operating system.

### Installation

#### Windows
- Run the downloaded installer.
- If select "Administrator", then select "Register Anaconda as the system Python" during installation. (recommended)
- If select "Just Me", then check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" during installation.
- Complete the installation process.

#### Mac
- Open Terminal and run the downloaded `.sh` script: `bash Anaconda3-2023.03-MacOSX-x86_64.sh` (version number may vary).
- Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

#### Linux
- Open Terminal and run the downloaded `.sh` script: `bash Anaconda3-2023.03-Linux-x86_64.sh` (version number may vary).
- Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### Verify Anaconda Installation
- Open a new terminal window.
- Type `python` and verify the output includes "packaged by Anaconda, Inc."

## Install PyCharm
PyCharm is a powerful IDE specifically designed for Python development.

### PyCharm Editions
PyCharm comes in several editions:
- **Community Edition**: Free and open-source, suitable for pure Python development.
- **Professional Edition**: Paid version with additional features for web development, database management, and more.
- **Educational Edition**: Free for educational purposes, includes features included in the Professional Edition. You can learn more and apply for an educational license [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

### Download PyCharm
- Go to the [PyCharm download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and download the appropriate edition for your operating system.

### Installation

#### Windows
- Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard.
- Select the option to "Add PyCharm to context menu (right-click menu)" for easier access.
- Optionally, choose to create a desktop shortcut.

#### Mac
- Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag PyCharm to the Applications folder.

#### Linux
- Extract the downloaded tarball and run `./pycharm.sh` from the `bin` subdirectory.

## Configure PyCharm with Anaconda

### Open PyCharm
Create a new project or open an existing one.

### Set Up Anaconda Environment
- Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on Mac).
- Navigate to `Project: <project_name>` > `Python Interpreter`.
- Click the gear icon and select `Add`.
- Choose `System Environment` or `Conda Environment` and specify the path to your Anaconda installation.

### Configure Terminal for Conda
- If the `(base)` prefix does not appear in front of the command prompt, set the default terminal to Conda by going to `File` > `Settings` > `Tools` > `Terminal` and setting the shell path to the Conda terminal executable.

## Exclude Data and Output Folders

### Mark as Excluded
- Right-click on the data/output folder in the Project tool window.
- Select `Mark Directory as` > `Excluded`.

## Using Terminal vs. Jupyter Notebooks to Run Python Scripts

### Terminal
- **Best for Large Projects and Automation**: Use the terminal for running large projects with multiple modules, automating tasks, and handling performance-intensive scripts. It's more suitable for managing virtual environments and integrating with version control systems like Git.

### Jupyter Notebooks
- **Best for Demos and Proof of Concepts**: Ideal for proof of concept, data visualization of demo, and creating well-documented reports. Use notebooks when you need to quickly prototype ideas or demonstrate concepts.

By following these steps, you will have a powerful and efficient Python development environment set up with PyCharm and Anaconda, ready for any data science or development projects.

## Debugging

Effective debugging is crucial for developing robust Python applications. Here are three methods to debug your Python scripts:

### Basic Debugging with `print()` and `exit()`
Use `print()` statements to output variable values and the flow of execution. This method is quick and effective for simple debugging tasks.

Example:
```python
def add(a, b):
    print(f"Adding {a} and {b}")
    result = a + b
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    return result

add(2, 3)
exit()  # Terminate the script here for inspection
```

### Advanced Debugging with `pdb`
The Python debugger (`pdb`) allows for more fine-tuned debugging, such as setting breakpoints and stepping through code.

To use `pdb`:
1. Import `pdb` in your script.
2. Insert `pdb.set_trace()` where you want to start debugging.

Example:
```python
import pdb

def add(a, b):
    pdb.set_trace()  # Start debugging here
    result = a + b
    return result

add(2, 3)
```

### PyCharm Interactive Runner
If you are not using the terminal, PyCharm's interactive runner provides a user-friendly debugging environment with powerful features such as breakpoints, watches, and variable inspection.

To use PyCharm's interactive runner:
1. Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
2. Right-click your script and select "Debug" to start the debugger.
3. Use the debugging controls to step through your code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions.

These methods offer a range of options for debugging, from quick checks with `print()` and `exit()`, to detailed inspection with `pdb`, to a comprehensive debugging environment in PyCharm. Choose the method that best fits your debugging needs.

## Additional Tips
- **Using Terminal Instead of PyCharm Runner**:
  - It's recommended to use the Terminal for running scripts to avoid issues with the built-in runner.
  
- **Code Navigation**:
  - One of the advantages of using PyCharm over VSCode is the ability to navigate to definitions with `Ctrl + Left Click`.

- **Educational Licenses**:
  - If you're a student or educator, you can apply for a free educational license for PyCharm Professional Edition through the JetBrains website [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
